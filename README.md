# Spots

_The front-facing React part_

## Setup For Development
1. Clone repo
2. CD into repo ```/client``` directory, install node packages: ```$ npm install```
3. Make sure Back-end node+express repo has ports configured (if you're working from the spots back-end repo in the same bitbucket project this should already be fine)

## Running App
1. CD into the ```/client``` directory
2. Start node via: ```$ npm start ```
3. Server should be running on http://localhost:3000/

## Other React Commands (copied here for future reference)
- ```npm start``` builds dev server
- ```npm run build``` builds app into static files for prod
- ```npm test``` starts test runner
- see ```client/README.md``` for more information
